# Introduction:-
This is a System Activity Report (SAR) generator project which will generate  reports regarding health of various nodes in a Cluster.
Here we are going to use SAR logs to do our analysis. So we must have an idea about what is Sar logs?

SAR stands for System Activity Report. It is used to collect a system's Resource utilisation such as CPU uilisation, memory utilsation, disk utilisation etc. We will also do
the same thing in our project here.

#Objective:- 
To generate every Node's Utilisation report on the fly in a cluster to know which node can be used for the new work a cluster is getting. It can also help in identifying any issues 
a particular node is facing in a cluster. We will see how uilised a node/system is based on below 3 parameters:-
  1) Node/System's CPU utilization.
  2) Node/Sytem's Memory Utilization.
  3) Node/System's Disk space Utilization
